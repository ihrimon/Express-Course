### Routing
Routing refers to how an application defines and manages different endpoints (URIs means for Uniform Resource Identifier) for handling client requests. Each route determines how the application responds to a specific HTTP method for a given path or URL. 

Syntax:
```Javascript
app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER);
```
